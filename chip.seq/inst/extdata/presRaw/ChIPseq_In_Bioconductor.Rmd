## The data

Our raw ChIPseq sequencing data will be in FASTQ format.

<div align="center">
<img src="imgs/fq1.png" alt="igv" height="200" width="600">
</div>


---
## The data

In this ChIPseq workshop we will be investigating the genome wide binding patterns of the transcription factor Myc in mouse MEL and Ch12 cell lines.

We can retrieve the raw sequencing data from Encode website.

Here we download the sequencing data for the Myc ChIPseq from the Mouse MEL cell line[, sample **ENCSR000EUA** (replicate 1), using the Encode portal.](https://www.encodeproject.org/experiments/ENCSR000EUA/)

The direct link to the raw sequecing reads in FastQ format can be found [here.](https://www.encodeproject.org/files/ENCFF001NQP/@@download/ENCFF001NQP.fastq.gz)

Download the fastQ for the other Myc MEL replicate from [sample ENCSR000EUA](https://www.encodeproject.org/experiments/ENCSR000EUA/). Direct link is [here](https://www.encodeproject.org/files/ENCFF001NQQ/@@download/ENCFF001NQQ.fastq.gz).

  cat("# Working with raw ChIPseq data

}

```

## Working with raw ChIPseq data

Once we have downloaded the raw fastQ data we can use the [ShortRead package](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ShortRead.html) to review our sequence data quality.

We have reviewed how to work with raw sequencing data in the [**FastQ in Bioconductor** session.](https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/Bioconductor_Introduction/presentations/slides/FastQInBioconductor.html#1)

First we load the [ShortRead library.](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ShortRead.html)


```{r shortreada,include=FALSE}
library(ShortRead)

```

```{r shortread, warning=F, message=F}
library(ShortRead)
```

---
## Working with raw ChIPseq data

First we will review the raw sequencing reads using functions in the [ShortRead package.](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ShortRead.html) This is similar to our QC we performed for RNAseq. 

We do not need to review all reads in the file to can gain an understanding of data quality. We can simply review a subsample of the reads and save ourselves some time and memory.

Note when we subsample we retrieve random reads from across the entire fastQ file. This is important as fastQ files are often ordered by their position on the sequencer.

---
## Reading raw ChIPseq data

We can subsample from a fastQ file using functions in **ShortRead** package.

Here we use the [**FastqSampler** and **yield** function](https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/Bioconductor_Introduction/presentations/slides/FastQInBioconductor.html#41) to randomly sample a defined number of reads from a fastQ file. Here we subsample 1 million reads.

```{r, echo=F,eval=F}
fqSample <- FastqSampler("~/Downloads/ENCFF001NQP.fastq.gz",n=10^6)
fastq <- yield(fqSample)

writeFastq(fastq,file = "~/Documents/Box Sync/RU/Teaching/RU_side/RU_ChIPseq/chipseq/inst/extdata/data/sampled_ENCFF001NQP.fastq.gz",mode = "w")

```

```{r eval=T, echo=F}
fastq <- readFastq(dirPath = "data/sampled_ENCFF001NQP.fastq.gz")
```

```{r mycRep1Reads,echo=T,eval=F}
fqSample <- FastqSampler("~/Downloads/ENCFF001NQP.fastq.gz",n=10^6)
fastq <- yield(fqSample)
```

---
## Working with raw ChIPseq data

The resulting object is a [ShortReadQ object](https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/Bioconductor_Introduction/presentations/slides/FastQInBioconductor.html#10) showing information on the number of cycles, base pairs in reads, and number of reads in memory.

```{r mycRep1ReadsShortReadQ,cache=TRUE,dependson="mycRep1Reads"}
fastq
```

---

## Raw ChIPseq data QC

If we wished, we can assess information from the fastQ file using our [familiar accessor functions.](https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/Bioconductor_Introduction/presentations/slides/FastQInBioconductor.html#15)

* **sread()** - Retrieve sequence of reads.
* **quality()** - Retrieve quality of reads as ASCI scores.
* **id()** - Retrieve IDs of reads.



```{r mycRep1ReadsAccessor,cache=TRUE,dependson="mycRep1Reads"}
readSequences <- sread(fastq)
readQuality <- quality(fastq)
readIDs <- id(fastq)
readSequences
```

---
## Quality with raw ChIPseq data

We can check some simple quality metrics for our subsampled fastQ data.

First, we can review the overall reads' quality scores.

We use the [**alphabetScore()** function with our read's qualitys](https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/Bioconductor_Introduction/presentations/slides/FastQInBioconductor.html#28) to retrieve the sum quality for every read from our subsample.



```{r mycRep1ReadsQScores,cache=TRUE,dependson="mycRep1Reads"}
readQuality <- quality(fastq)
readQualities <- alphabetScore(readQuality)
readQualities[1:10]
```

---

## Quality with raw ChIPseq data

We can then produce a histogram of quality scores to get a better understanding of the distribution of scores.

```{r mycRep1ReadsQScoresPlot,cache=TRUE,dependson="mycRep1ReadsQScores",fig.height=3,fig.width=8}
library(ggplot2)
toPlot <- data.frame(ReadQ=readQualities)
ggplot(toPlot,aes(x=ReadQ))+geom_histogram()+theme_minimal()
```


---

## Base frequency with raw ChIPseq data

We can review the occurrence of DNA bases within reads and well as the occurrence of DNA bases across sequencing cycles using the [**alphabetFrequency()**](https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/Bioconductor_Introduction/presentations/slides/FastQInBioconductor.html#18) and [**alphabetByCycle()**](https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/Bioconductor_Introduction/presentations/slides/FastQInBioconductor.html#30) functions respectively.

Here we check the overall frequency of **A, G, C, T and N (unknown bases)** in our sequence reads.

```{r mycRep1ReadsAlpFreq,cache=TRUE,dependson="mycRep1Reads"}
readSequences <- sread(fastq)
readSequences_AlpFreq <- alphabetFrequency(readSequences)
readSequences_AlpFreq[1:3,]
```


---

## Base frequency with raw ChIPseq data

Once we have the frequency of DNA bases in our sequence reads we can retrieve the sum across all reads.

```{r mycRep1ReadsAlpFreqSum,cache=TRUE,dependson="mycRep1ReadsAlpFreq"}
summed__AlpFreq  <- colSums(readSequences_AlpFreq)
summed__AlpFreq[c("A","C","G","T","N")]
```

---

## Assess by cycle with raw ChIPseq data

We can review DNA base occurrence by cycle using the [**alphabetByCycle()** function.](https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/Bioconductor_Introduction/presentations/slides/FastQInBioconductor.html#30)

```{r mycRep1ReadsAlpByCycle,cache=TRUE,dependson="mycRep1ReadsAlpFreq"}
readSequences_AlpbyCycle <- alphabetByCycle(readSequences)
readSequences_AlpbyCycle[1:4,1:10]
```

---

## Assess by cycle with raw ChIPseq data

We often plot this to visualise the base occurrence over cycles to observe any bias.
First we arrange the base frequency into a data frame.

```{r mycRep1ReadsAlpByCyclePlot,cache=TRUE,dependson="mycRep1ReadsAlpFreq"}
AFreq <- readSequences_AlpbyCycle["A",]
CFreq <- readSequences_AlpbyCycle["C",]
GFreq <- readSequences_AlpbyCycle["G",]
TFreq <- readSequences_AlpbyCycle["T",]
toPlot <- data.frame(Count=c(AFreq,CFreq,GFreq,TFreq),
                     Cycle=rep(1:36,4),
                     Base=rep(c("A","C","G","T"),each=36))

```

---

## Assess by cycle with raw ChIPseq data

Now we can plot the frequencies using ggplot2

```{r mycRep1ReadsAlpByCyclePlot2,cache=TRUE,eval=FALSE,dependson="mycRep1ReadsAlpByCyclePlot",fig.height=4,fig.width=8}

ggplot(toPlot,aes(y=Count,x=Cycle,colour=Base))+geom_line()+
  theme_bw()
```

```{r mycRep1ReadsAlpByCyclePlot3,cache=TRUE,echo=FALSE,dependson="mycRep1ReadsAlpByCyclePlot",fig.height=4,fig.width=8}

ggplot(toPlot,aes(y=Count,x=Cycle,colour=Base))+geom_line()+ylim(150000,400000)+
  theme_bw()
```
---

## Assess by cycle with raw ChIPseq data

We can also assess mean read quality over cycles. This will allow us to identify whether there are any isses with quality dropping off over time.

For this we use the [**as(*read_quality*,"matrix")**](https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/Bioconductor_Introduction/presentations/slides/FastQInBioconductor.html#29) function first to translate our ASCI quality scores to numeric quality scores.

```{r mycRep1ReadsQByCycle,cache=TRUE,dependson="mycRep1ReadsAlpFreq"}
qualAsMatrix <- as(readQuality,"matrix")
qualAsMatrix[1:2,]
```

---

## Assess by cycle with raw ChIPseq data

We can now [visualise qualities across cycles using a boxplot.](https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/Bioconductor_Introduction/exercises/answers/fastq_answers.html)

```{r mycRep1ReadsQByCyclePlot,cache=TRUE,dependson="mycRep1ReadsQByCycle",fig.width=8,fig.height=4}
boxplot(qualAsMatrix[1:1000,])
```

---

## Assess by cycle with raw ChIPseq data

In this case the distribution of reads quality scores and read qualities over time look okay. We will often want to access fastQ samples together to see if any samples stick out by these metrics.

Here we observed a second population of low quality scores so will remove some reads with low quality scores and high unknown bases.

---
"    
  )
}else{
  cat("# Filtering data

---
"    
  )
  
}

```


## Filtering data

We will want to conserve our memory usage to [allow us to deal with loading large files.](https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/Bioconductor_Introduction/presentations/slides/FastQInBioconductor.html#40)

Here we set up a **FastqStreamer object** to read in 100000 reads at a time. 

```{r out,eval=FALSE}
fqStreamer <- FastqStreamer("~/Downloads/ENCFF001NQP.fastq.gz",
                            n=100000)
```

---

## Filtering data

Now we [loop through file](https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/Bioconductor_Introduction/presentations/slides/FastQInBioconductor.html#43), filter reads and [write out a FastQ](https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/Bioconductor_Introduction/presentations/slides/FastQInBioconductor.html#39) of our filtered reads.

We are filtering low quality reads and reads with many nonspecific (N) base calls. 

```{r out1,eval=FALSE}
TotalReads <- 0
TotalReadsFilt <- 0
while (length(fq <- yield(fqStreamer))>0) {
    TotalReads <- TotalReads+length(fq)
    filt1 <- fq[alphabetScore(fq) > 300 ]
    filt2 <- filt1[alphabetFrequency(sread(filt1))[,"N"] < 10]
    TotalReadsFilt <- TotalReadsFilt+length(filt2)
    writeFastq(filt2,"filtered_ENCFF001NQP.fastq.gz",mode="a")
}
```
```{r,echo=F,eval=T}
TotalReads<-25555179
TotalReadsFilt<-22864597

```
```{r out11,eval=T,echo=T}
TotalReads
TotalReadsFilt
```

---
```{r, results='asis',include=TRUE,echo=FALSE}
if(params$isSlides == "yes"){
  cat("class: inverse, center, middle

# Aligning data

---
"    
  )
}else{
  cat("# Aligning data

---
"    
  )
  
}

```

---
## Aligning ChIPseq reads

Following assessment of read quality and any read filtering we applied, we will want to align our reads to the genome so as to identify any genomic locations showing enrichment for aligned reads above background.

Since ChIPseq reads will align continously against our reference genome we can use [our genomic aligners we have seen in previous sessions.](https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/Bioconductor_Introduction/r_course/presentations/slides/AlignmentInBioconductor.html#7) The resulting BAM file will contain aligned sequence reads for use in further analysis.

<div align="center">
<img src="imgs/sam2.png" alt="igv" height="200" width="600">
</div>

---
## Creating a reference genome

First we need to retrieve the sequence information for the genome of interest in [FASTA format](https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/Genomic_Data/presentations/slides/GenomicsData.html#9)

We can use the [BSgenome libraries to retrieve the full sequence information.](https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/Bioconductor_Introduction/presentations/slides/SequencesInBioconductor.html#4)

For the mouse mm10 genome we load the package **BSgenome.Mmusculus.UCSC.mm10**.

```{r fa1q, include=FALSE}
library(BSgenome.Mmusculus.UCSC.mm10)
```

```{r fa1, echo=TRUE}
library(BSgenome.Mmusculus.UCSC.mm10)
BSgenome.Mmusculus.UCSC.mm10
```

---
## Creating a reference genome

We will only use the major chromosomes for our analysis so we may exclude random and unplaced contigs.
Here we cycle through the major chromosomes and create a [**DNAStringSet** object from the retrieved sequences](https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/Bioconductor_Introduction/r_course/presentations/slides/SequencesInBioconductor.html#17).

```{r fa2,cache=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
mainChromosomes <- paste0("chr",c(1:19,"X","Y","M"))
mainChrSeq <- lapply(mainChromosomes,
                     function(x)BSgenome.Mmusculus.UCSC.mm10[[x]])
names(mainChrSeq) <- mainChromosomes
mainChrSeqSet <- DNAStringSet(mainChrSeq)
mainChrSeqSet
```

---
# Creating a reference genome.

Now we have a **DNAStringSet** object we can use the [**writeXStringSet** to create our FASTA file of sequences to align to.](https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/Bioconductor_Introduction/presentations/slides/SequencesInBioconductor.html#22)

```{r fa3, echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
writeXStringSet(mainChrSeqSet,
                "BSgenome.Mmusculus.UCSC.mm10.mainChrs.fa")
```


---
## Creating an Rsubread index 

We will be aligning using the **subjunc** algorithm from the folks behind subread. We can therefore use the **Rsubread** package. Before we attempt to align our fastq files, we will need to first build an index from our reference genome using the **buildindex()** function.

The [**buildindex()** function simply takes the parameters of our desired index name and the FASTA file to build index from.](https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/Bioconductor_Introduction/r_course/presentations/slides/AlignmentInBioconductor.html#14)

REMEMBER: Building an index is memory intensive and by default is set to 8GB. This may be too large for your laptop or Desktop. 

Luckily we did this for RNAseq, so hopefully you will already have a built index. 
```{r, echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
library(Rsubread)
buildindex("mm10_mainchrs","BSgenome.Mmusculus.UCSC.mm10.mainChrs.fa", 
           memory=8000,
           indexSplit=TRUE)

```


---
## Rsubread ChIPseq alignment

We can align our raw sequence data in fastQ format to the new FASTA file of our mm10 genome sequence using the **Rsubread** package. Specifically we will be using the **align** function as this utilizes the subread genomic alignment algorithm. 

The [**align()** function accepts arguments for the index to align to, the fastQ to align, the name of output BAM, the mode of alignment (rna or dna) and the phredOffset.](https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/Bioconductor_Introduction/presentations/slides/AlignmentInBioconductor.html#15)

Note that here we set the phredOffset to be 64. Rsubread may get upset if we set this wrong.

```{r, echo=F, eval=F}
myMapped <- align("~/Documents/Box Sync/RU/Teaching/Compilation/Genomes_And_Datasets/mm10/mm10_mainchrs",
                    "filtered_ENCFF001NQP.fastq.gz",
                    output_format = "BAM",
                    output_file = "Myc_Mel_1.bam",
                    nthreads = 4)

```


```{r, echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}

myMapped <- align("mm10_mainchrs",
                    "filtered_ENCFF001NQP.fastq.gz",
                    output_format = "BAM",
                    output_file = "Myc_Mel_1.bam",
                    type='dna',
                    phredOffset = 64,
                    nthreads = 4)

```

---
## Rbowtie2 ChIPseq alignment

One of the most well known group of alignment alogorthims are the Bowtie family. We can access Bowtie2 with the **Rbowtie2** package.

The **QuasR** package allows access to the original Bowtie aligner, but it is a little slow and memory hungry.

```{r sampleTabless1, echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
library(Rbowtie2)
```

---
## Rbowtie2 ChIPseq alignment

As with **Rsubread**, the **Rbowtie2** package requires us to first to create an index to align to.

We can do this using the **bowtie2_build()** function, specifying our FASTA file and desired name of index.

```{r bsgecdnoaame, echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
bowtie2_build(references="BSgenome.Mmusculus.UCSC.mm10.mainChrs.fa", 
                       bt2Index=file.path("BSgenome.Mmusculus.UCSC.mm10.mainChrs"))
```

---
## Rbowtie2 ChIPseq alignment

We can then align our fastq data using the **bowtie2()** function specifying our newly created index, the desired name of SAM output and an uncompressed fastq.

We will need to uncompress our fastq then first. Here we use the **remove** is FALSE settin to maintain original compressed fastQ

```{r bsgcdcenoaame, echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
library(R.utils)
gunzip("filtered_ENCFF001NQP.fastq.gz",
       remove=FALSE)

bowtie2(bt2Index = "BSgenome.Mmusculus.UCSC.mm10.mainChrs",
          samOutput = "ENCFF001NQP.sam",
          seq1 = "filtered_ENCFF001NQP.fastq")
```

---
# Rbowtie2 ChIPseq alignment

Since Rbowtie2 also outputs a SAM file, we would need to need to convert to a BAM file. We can do this with the **RSamtools** **asBam()** function.

```{r bsgenoaaxssme, echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
bowtieBam <- asBam("ENCFF001NQP.sam")
```


---
## Rbowtie2 ChIPseq alignment

An important consideration when using Rbowtie2 is its input and output of uncompressed files.

On the command line we may *stream* inputs to Rbowtie2, but in R this isnt an option (yet!)

We would need to make sure we delete any temporary files created (SAM and/or uncompressed FastQ) to avoid filling up our hard drives. We can delete files in R using the **unlink()** function.

```{r bsgxxxnoaaxssme, echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
unlink("ENCFF001NQP.sam")

```

---

## Sort and index reads

As before, we sort and index our files using the [**Rsamtools** packages **sortBam()** and **indexBam()** functions respectively.](https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/Bioconductor_Introduction/r_course/presentations/slides/AlignedDataInBioconductor.html#10)

The resulting sorted and indexed BAM file is now ready for use in external programs such as IGV as well as for further downstream analysis in R.

```{r sortindex, echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
library(Rsamtools)
sortBam("Myc_Mel_1.bam","SR_Myc_Mel_rep1")
indexBam("SR_Myc_Mel_rep1.bam")
```

---
```{r, results='asis',include=TRUE,echo=FALSE}
if(params$isSlides == "yes"){
  cat("class: inverse, center, middle

# Mapped data

<html><div style='float:left'></div><hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=720px></html> 

---
"    
  )
}else{
  cat("# Mapped data

---
"    
  )
  
}

```

---

## Mapped reads

Now we have the index for the BAM file, we can retrieve and plot the number of mapped reads using [the **idxstatsBam()** function.](https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/Bioconductor_Introduction//presentations/slides/AlignedDataInBioconductor.html#16)

```{R, eval=F, echo=F}
mappedReads <- idxstatsBam("SR_Myc_Mel_1.bam")
save(mappedReads, file="data/idxstatsBam_MycMel.RData")
```


```{r mapped1, echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
mappedReads <- idxstatsBam("SR_Myc_Mel_rep1.bam")
TotalMapped <- sum(mappedReads[,"mapped"])
ggplot(mappedReads,aes(x=seqnames,y=mapped))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity")+coord_flip()
```

```{r mapped, echo=FALSE,eval=TRUE,fig.width=4,fig.height=4}
load("data/idxstatsBam_MycMel.RData")
TotalMapped <- sum(mappedReads[,"mapped"])
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ggplot2))
ggplot(mappedReads,aes(x=seqnames,y=mapped))+geom_bar(stat="identity")+coord_flip()
```

---
## Create a bigWig

We can also create a bigWig from our sorted, indexed BAM file to allow us to quickly review our data in IGV.

First we use the [**coverage()** function to create an **RLElist object** containing our coverage scores.](https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/Bioconductor_Introduction/presentations/slides/Summarising_Scores_In_Bioconductor.html#13)

```{r coverage, echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
forBigWig <- coverage("SR_Myc_Mel_rep1.bam")
forBigWig
```

---

## Create a bigWig

We can now export our [**RLElist object** as a bigWig using the **rtracklayer** package's **export.bw()** function.](https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/Bioconductor_Introduction/presentations/slides/GenomicScores_In_Bioconductor.html#40)

```{r bw, echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
library(rtracklayer)
export.bw(forBigWig,con="SR_Myc_Mel_rep1.bw")
```


---
## Create a bigWig

We may wish to normalize our coverage to allow us to compare enrichment across samples.

We can use the [**weight** parameter in the **coverage()**](https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/Bioconductor_Introduction/presentations/slides/Summarising_Scores_In_Bioconductor.html#20) to scale our reads to the number of mapped reads multiplied by a million (reads per million).

```{r weightedCover, echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
forBigWig <- coverage("SR_Myc_Mel_rep1.bam",
                      weight = (10^6)/TotalMapped)
forBigWig
export.bw(forBigWig,con="SR_Myc_Mel_rep1_weighted.bw")
```
